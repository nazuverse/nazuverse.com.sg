            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I'm <strong>Nazurah Mazlan</strong>, a Singapore-based writer who loves exploring cognition, worlds, and language through research and storytelling.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m not a professional psychologist—so I really hope no one comes to me for therapy! I’m also not a professional writer (yet). I haven’t published a book, but I have countless poems waiting to be written and shared.
            </p>
            <p>
                One thing about me? I love a simple life. I’m not into overly complicated stories, and my ambitions aren’t sky-high. But I have enough in my life to live for an <em>eternal happiness</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m on my own beautiful journey of life and storytelling. I love diving deep into the ways people think, which is why I enjoy meaningful conversations. Through talking with others, I believe our minds and worlds expand—it’s a way to appreciate and understand different perspectives. I’m still in the process of finding myself, and every conversation helps me get closer.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also love walking in nature, reflecting on life, and finding calm in simple moments.
            </p>
            <p>
                And one last (very important) thing: <strong>I LOVE CATS TO DEATH!</strong> They are adorable, snuggly creatures, perfect for warming up on a cold day—or just when you need a little happiness.
